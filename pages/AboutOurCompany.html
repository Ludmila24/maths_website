    <p>CPG is a privately owned company, founded by Richard Parsons in 1995. He was a maths teacher who resigned from his
    permanent role at Furness College because he was dissatisfied with the poor quality of study guides at that time, and he
    could not influence it working in his role. He then published his first guide in mathematics which was shared among
    several schools and became a success.
    He became a very popular writer in his subject and set up a CPG company. After he opened his company other teachers
    started to publish and sell his books through CPG.
    In 2020 CPG company sold 12 million products and became one of the leading educational publishers.
    CPG books are popular because they present study material in a concise and simple way focusing on what is needed for
    exams. These books allow revising the material fast before the exams or even learning the material from scratch.
    For more information, please visit the CPG website at <a href="https://www.cgpbooks.co.uk/">www.cpgbooks.co.uk</a></p>
